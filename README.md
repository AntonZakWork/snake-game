# Snake game

This small project is a desktop snake game. In the current version, it is possible to change the size of the field and the speed of the snake. Users also could pause the game (Spacebar) or change settings using a button in the right upper corner. It is possible to change the settings immediately (restart the current game) or after the end of the current game. This project was created using React.js, Redux Toolkit, SCSS and React Hook Form.
